# FindWeather
A simple NodeJS and Express application that uses Weather API from openweatherapp.org.
The API is given with a key for each user, using that when our server runs we do an API call and provide it with the city of whose temprature we are concerned.
The API returns a JSON consisting of various information out of which temprature, description and an image signifying the weather is rendered on the screen.
